# Simple company site

This is a dotnet template used in the nuget package [Relatude.Demos](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Relatude.Demos).  
We use https://github.com/Relatude/WAF.Demo.DemoBuilder to build it.  
The template has a template configuration file here: [.template.config/template.json](https://github.com/Relatude/WAF.Demo.SimpleCompany/blob/master/.template.config/template.json)  

This project contains the Simple company site demo.

<br />
Since this is a dotnet template, we need the repo to be a fully functional project, including content and database. As such, there is a `Relatude.setup.ignore` in the repo. This is renamed to `Relatude.setup` when the builder repo processes this repo.
